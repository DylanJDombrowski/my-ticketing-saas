# 🚀 Start Here - Complete Fix & Test Guide

## ✅ What We Fixed

1. **Stripe API Version Error** - Fixed TypeScript error with API version
2. **Invoice Count Sync** - Created SQL script to sync counts
3. **Client Portal Tokens** - Fixed RLS policy blocking token creation

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Run the SQL Fix Script ⚡

**Where:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zpplkvwykqvwdzuvjdwz/sql

**What to paste:** Contents of `FIX_BOTH_ISSUES_NOW.sql`

**This will:**
- ✅ Sync your invoice count (0 → 4)
- ✅ Add RLS policy for portal tokens
- ✅ Create portal tokens retroactively
- ✅ Show verification results

**Expected Output:**
```
-- After running, you should see:

Verification Results:
- Invoice Counts: 2 synced, 0 out_of_sync ✅
- Portal Tokens: 1 total, 1 active ✅
- System Status: ✅ BOTH ISSUES FIXED
```

---

### Step 2: Verify the Fix in Database 🔍

**Run these quick checks:**

```sql
-- Check 1: Invoice count synced?
SELECT name, invoice_count, invoice_limit FROM tenants;
-- Should show: invoice_count = 4, invoice_limit = 2

-- Check 2: Portal tokens created?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client_portal_access WHERE is_active = true;
-- Should show: count > 0
```

---

### Step 3: Test Invoice Limit Enforcement 🧪

**Open your app:** https://trybillable.com/dashboard

1. **Try to create a 5th invoice**
   - Expected: ❌ Upgrade prompt appears
   - Shows: "4 / 2 invoices" (you're over limit)

2. **If prompt doesn't appear:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify invoice_count = 4 in database
   - Make sure you're on the right tenant account

---

### Step 4: Test Upgrade Flow 💳

**In the upgrade prompt:**

1. Click **"Upgrade Now"**
   - Should redirect to Stripe Checkout
   - URL starts with: `checkout.stripe.com`

2. **Use test card:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

3. **Complete payment**
   - Should redirect back to: `/dashboard/settings?success=true`

4. **Verify in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT subscription_status, invoice_limit FROM tenants;
   -- Should show: subscription_status = 'active', invoice_limit = 999999
   ```

---

### Step 5: Test Client Portal 🌐

**Send a new invoice:**

1. Create invoice (should work now after upgrading)
2. Click "Send" to email it to client
3. Check your email inbox

**In the email:**
- ✅ Should have "View Client Portal" button
- ✅ Link looks like: `/client-portal/AbC123XyZ...` (long random token)

**Click the portal link:**
- ✅ Should load: "Welcome, [Name]!"
- ✅ Shows invoice statistics
- ✅ Lists all invoices for that client
- ✅ Can view/download PDFs

**If you see "Access Denied":**
- Portal token wasn't created
- Check server logs when you sent the email
- Verify RLS policy exists (run Step 1 again)

---

### Step 6: Test Reminder Emails 📧

**Send a payment reminder:**

1. Go to invoice list
2. Find an invoice, click "..." menu
3. Click "Send Reminder"
4. Check email

**Expected:**
- ✅ Reminder email received
- ✅ Contains portal link
- ✅ Portal link works when clicked

---

### Step 7: Run Full Test Suite 📋

**Use the comprehensive checklist:**

Open: `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`

This has 20 detailed tests covering:
- Invoice limits (5 tests)
- Client portal (5 tests)
- Stripe webhooks (3 tests)
- Edge cases (3 tests)
- Final verification queries

## 🎯 Quick Success Check

**Run this single query to verify everything:**

```sql
SELECT
  'Invoice Limits' as feature,
  CASE
    WHEN t.invoice_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE tenant_id = t.id)
    THEN '✅ Working'
    ELSE '❌ Broken'
  END as status
FROM tenants t
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Portal Tokens' as feature,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client_portal_access WHERE is_active = true) > 0
    THEN '✅ Working'
    ELSE '❌ Broken'
  END as status
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Subscription' as feature,
  subscription_status || ' (limit: ' || invoice_limit || ')'
FROM tenants;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
feature         | status
----------------|------------------
Invoice Limits  | ✅ Working
Portal Tokens   | ✅ Working
Subscription    | active (limit: 999999)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Upgrade prompt doesn't show

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT invoice_count, invoice_limit FROM tenants;
```

**Fix:** If invoice_count < invoice_limit, run UPDATE query again

---

### Problem: Portal shows "Access Denied"

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client_portal_access WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Fix:** If count = 0:
1. Check server logs for INSERT errors
2. Verify RLS policy exists
3. Re-run FIX_BOTH_ISSUES_NOW.sql Part 2

---

### Problem: Webhook not firing

**Check Stripe Dashboard:**
https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events

**Fix:**
1. Verify webhook endpoint is configured
2. Check STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches
3. Look for error details in Stripe logs
