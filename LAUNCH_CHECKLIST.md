Hi [Name],

I know you [freelance/consult/run an agency], so I thought you might find this useful.

I just launched TryBillable (trybillable.com) - it's time tracking + invoicing + payment collection all in one place.

No more juggling Toggl, QuickBooks, and chasing late payments over email.

I'm looking for 50 beta users to test it out. Would you be up for trying it and giving me honest feedback?

It's free during beta, and I'll throw in 3 months free when we go live.

Let me know!

P.S. You can sign up here: https://trybillable.com/signup
