## 🎯 ONE FINAL MIGRATION (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Apply Fixed Migration

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251003000003_payment_methods_final.sql`

**What to do:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of the file above
3. Paste and Run
4. Done!

**This migration:**
- Drops old `payment_methods` table (if exists)
- Creates new one with `profile_id` (correct!)
- Adds RLS policies
- Creates indexes

---

## ✅ Verification (30 seconds)

After running migration, test:

```sql
-- Should return 1 row
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name = 'payment_methods';

-- Should return 'profile_id'
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'payment_methods' AND column_name = 'profile_id';
```

## 📝 Beta User Email Template

```
Subject: Can you test my invoicing app?

Hey [Name]!

I just finished building a time tracking + invoicing tool for freelancers and consultants.

Takes 5 minutes to:
• Add a client
• Track some time
• Generate a professional invoice

Would love your honest feedback!

Link: [your-url-here]

Let me know what you think 😊

[Your name]
```

## 🐛 Known Non-Issues

**"PDF downloads as HTML"**
- That's by design! Users can Cmd+P → Save as PDF
- Works perfectly, no library needed

**"No email sent"**
- Correct for beta - you manually share invoice links
- Email automation comes in Week 2 if needed

**"Manual payment only"**
- Perfect for beta! Most freelancers use Venmo/Zelle
- Stripe Connect available Week 2 if users want it
