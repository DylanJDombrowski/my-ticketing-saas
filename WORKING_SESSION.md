## Quick Debugging

### Check Auth Status
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.email, p.tenant_id, t.name
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.id
LEFT JOIN tenants t ON p.tenant_id = t.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Verify Trigger
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

### Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT polname, pg_get_expr(polqual, polrelid)
FROM pg_policy
WHERE polrelid = 'public.profiles'::regclass;
```

## Bug Fixes This Session

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Invoice "No Billable Hours" Issue

**Problem:** Creating invoices showed "no billable hours" even after logging time for clients.

**Root Cause:** Invoice modal ([src/components/modals/invoice-modal.tsx](src/components/modals/invoice-modal.tsx)) had 3 critical bugs:
1. `availableTimeEntries` state never populated (fetched data but didn't save it to state)
2. Hardcoded rate of $75 instead of using actual `client.hourly_rate` or `user.default_hourly_rate`
3. Client filtering not properly wired up

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed `loadUnbilledTimeEntries()` to get data from store and update local state
- Updated rate calculation: `entry.ticket?.client?.hourly_rate ?? entry.user?.default_hourly_rate ?? 0`
- Applied rate fix to both invoice summary calculation and table display

**Correct Workflow:**
1. **Create Client** ‚Üí Set `hourly_rate` field (e.g., $150/hr)
2. **Create Ticket** ‚Üí Link to that client
3. **Log Time Entry** ‚Üí
   - Select the ticket (auto-links to client via foreign key)
   - **Mark as `is_billable: true`** ‚úÖ IMPORTANT!
   - Enter hours worked (e.g., 5 hours)
4. **Create Invoice** ‚Üí
   - Select the client from dropdown
   - Modal fetches and displays unbilled billable time entries
   - Select entries to include
   - Invoice calculates: `5 hours √ó $150/hr = $750`

**Files Modified:**
- [src/components/modals/invoice-modal.tsx](src/components/modals/invoice-modal.tsx) - Fixed state population and rate calculations

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Missing Hourly Rate Field in Client Creation

**Problem:** Users couldn't set hourly rates when creating/editing clients, causing invoices to show $0.

**Root Cause:** The `hourly_rate` field exists in the database but was missing from:
1. TypeScript `Client` and `CreateClientForm` interfaces
2. TypeScript `Profile` interface (for `default_hourly_rate`)
3. Client creation/edit modal UI

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `hourly_rate?: number | null` to `Client` interface
- Added `hourly_rate?: number` to `CreateClientForm` interface
- Added `default_hourly_rate?: number | null` to `Profile` interface
- Added hourly rate input field to client modal with helper text
- Field appears after Phone, before Save button
- Supports decimal values (e.g., $150.00)

**Files Modified:**
- [src/lib/types.ts](src/lib/types.ts) - Added hourly_rate to Client, Profile, and form types
- [src/components/modals/client-modal.tsx](src/components/modals/client-modal.tsx) - Added hourly rate input field

**Rate Fallback Logic:**
When creating invoices, the system uses this priority:
1. Client's `hourly_rate` (set per client)
2. User's `default_hourly_rate` (defaults to $75 from DB)
3. Falls back to $0 if neither is set

**Remember:** The hard part is done. Now we test, polish, and ship! üöÄ
## Payment Strategy Decision

**See full analysis:** [PAYMENT_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md](PAYMENT_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md)

### The Question
"How do users receive payments from their clients?"

### The Answer
**Recommended: Stripe Connect** (Users connect their own Stripe accounts)

**Fallback: Manual Payment Instructions** (Bank transfer, Venmo, etc.)

**Implementation Plan:**
- Phase 1: Manual Payments (2 hours) - Ship for beta launch
- Phase 2: Stripe Connect (3-4 hours) - Add post-launch

**Full details in PAYMENT_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md**
