## 📧 Beta Invite Email Template

**Subject:** Can you test my new invoicing tool?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

I just built a time tracking + invoicing tool for freelancers.

Takes 5 minutes to:
• Create a client
• Track some time
• Generate a professional invoice

Would love your feedback! Here's the link:
[your-app-url]

Let me know what you think!

[Your Name]
```

## 💰 Payment Instructions (For Beta Users)

Since Stripe isn't integrated yet, users will:

1. Create invoice
2. Send to client
3. Invoice shows payment instructions like:
   ```
   Pay via:
   • Bank Transfer: Account 123456789
   • Venmo: @myusername
   • PayPal: paypal.me/username
   ```
4. Client pays outside system
5. User marks invoice as "Paid"

**This is perfect for beta!** Most freelancers use Venmo/Zelle anyway.

## 🐛 Known Issues (Totally Fine for Beta)

1. **PDF "Download"** → Actually opens HTML
   - **Fix:** Users can Cmd+P → Save as PDF
   - **Why:** No PDF library installed (intentional - keeps it simple)

2. **No email sent** → Invoice doesn't actually email
   - **Fix:** Users manually send invoice link or copy/paste
   - **Why:** Email service not configured yet

3. **Manual payment tracking** → No Stripe yet
   - **Fix:** Mark as paid manually
   - **Why:** Stripe Connect takes 3 more hours

**All of these are fine for 10-15 beta users!**

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Week 1:
- 5-10 signups ✅
- 3-5 active users ✅
- 10+ invoices created ✅
- 1+ invoice paid ✅

### If You Hit These:
→ You've validated the concept!

## 🎉 First Paying Customer Celebration

When someone marks their first invoice as "Paid":

1. Screenshot it
2. Share on Twitter: "First invoice paid through my SaaS! 🎉"
3. Thank your beta user
4. Keep building!

## 🚨 If Something Breaks

### App won't start:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Migration fails:
- Check Supabase dashboard for error
- Table might already exist (that's OK)
- Try re-running just the failing part

### Invoice shows $0:
- Client needs `hourly_rate` set
- Time entry must be marked "billable"
- Refresh page

### Can't send invoice:
- Client needs email address
- Check browser console for errors

## 📝 Feedback Questions for Beta Users

Ask each tester:

1. **Was signup easy?** (1-10)
2. **Could you create an invoice in under 5 min?**
3. **What feature is missing?**
4. **Would you pay $19/mo for this?**
5. **Do you need Stripe, or is Venmo/bank transfer fine?**

---

## 🔥 The Path Forward

**Tonight:** Ship beta
**Week 1:** Get 10 users, gather feedback
**Week 2:** Add Stripe Connect (if users want it)
**Week 3:** Polish based on feedback
**Week 4:** Launch publicly, start charging

**First Revenue Goal:** $100/mo (5 users × $20/mo)
**By Month 3:** $500/mo (25 users × $20/mo)
**By Month 6:** $2000/mo (100 users × $20/mo)

## ✅ Final Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] Migration applied to Supabase

- [ ] Invite 3-5 friends
- [ ] Set up feedback collection method (email, Notion, etc.)

## 🎯 Deployment (Optional - Can Do Later)

If you want to deploy tonight:

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)
npm install -g vercel
vercel

# Or deploy to Netlify
npm run build
# Upload /out folder
```

**But honestly:** localhost is fine for 5-10 beta users!
