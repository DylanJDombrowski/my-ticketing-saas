## 💡 For Beta Users

**Payment Instructions Example:**

When users create invoices, they can add:
```
Payment Options:
• Venmo: @myusername
• PayPal: paypal.me/myname
• Bank: Chase Account 123456789
• Zelle: (555) 123-4567
```

Then:
1. Send invoice to client
2. Client pays via their preferred method
3. User marks invoice as "Paid"

**This works PERFECTLY for beta!**

---

## 📊 Beta Success Criteria

**Week 1:**
- 5 signups
- 3 active users
- 10 invoices created
- 1 invoice paid

**If you hit these:**
→ Concept validated! ✅
→ Add Stripe Connect
→ Scale up

**If not:**

## 🚀 The Complete Flow

```
USER CREATES:
1. Client (Acme Corp, $150/hr, acme@example.com)
2. Ticket (Website Redesign)
3. Time Entry (5 hours, billable ✅)
4. Invoice (5 × $150 = $750)

USER SENDS:
5. Click "..." → "Send Invoice"
6. Confirms: "Send to acme@example.com?"
7. Status → "Sent" ✅

CLIENT PAYS:
8. Client receives invoice (you send link/email manually for beta)
9. Client sees payment instructions
10. Client pays via Venmo/Bank/etc.

USER CONFIRMS:
11. Click "..." → "Mark as Paid"
12. Status → "Paid" ✅
13. 🎉 First payment!
```

## 🎯 Week 2: Add Stripe Connect (Optional)

If beta users want credit card payments:

**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Features:**
- Users connect their Stripe accounts
- "Pay with Card" button on invoices
- Automatic payment tracking
- You can take 2% platform fee

**Guide:** [PAYMENT_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md](PAYMENT_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md)

**But for now:** Manual payments work great!
