## 🎯 STEP 1: Apply Database Migration (5 minutes)

**DO THIS FIRST!**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251003000001_add_payment_features.sql`
4. Copy ALL contents
5. Paste in SQL Editor
6. Click "Run"
7. Wait for success message

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Run this to verify migration worked:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'invoices' AND column_name = 'sent_at';
-- Should return 1 row
```

---

## 🎯 STEP 2: Test Your App (10 minutes)

```bash
# Start dev server (if not running)
npm run dev
```

### Test Workflow:
1. **Create Client** with hourly rate ($150)
2. **Create Ticket** for that client
3. **Log Time** (5 hours, mark as billable)
4. **Create Invoice**
   - Should see your 5 hours
   - Should calculate $750
5. **Send Invoice** (new button - coming in next code push)
6. **View PDF** - Should work!

## 🎯 STEP 3: What I'm Building Right Now (15 min)

- Confirms client email
- Marks invoice as "sent"
- Shows success notification

### B. Payment Instructions Field
- Add to invoice creation
- Shows in PDF
- Default instructions from settings

## 🚀 Beta Launch Strategy

### Week 1: Friends & Family (5-10 users)
**Pitch:** "I built an invoicing tool for freelancers. Can you try it and give feedback?"

**What they can do:**
1. Create clients
2. Track time
3. Generate invoices
4. Get paid (via manual methods - bank transfer, Venmo, etc.)

**Payment Flow (Manual):**
```
1. User creates invoice
2. User clicks "Send Invoice"
3. Invoice shows payment instructions:
   "Pay via: Venmo @myusername
    Or: Bank transfer to account 123456"
4. Client pays outside the system
5. User manually marks invoice as "Paid"
```

**Works perfectly for beta!** No Stripe needed yet.

### Week 2: Add Stripe Connect
Once you validate people want this, add:
- Stripe Connect setup (3 hours)
- "Pay with Card" button
- Automatic payment tracking

## ⚡ Quick Fixes Before Launch

- User can Cmd+P → Save as PDF
- Or use browser print function

### If invoice amounts are $0:

- Check time entries marked as billable
- Refresh the page
