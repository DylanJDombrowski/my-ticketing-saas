# Ticketing SaaS Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Ticketing SaaS application.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

### 🗺️ [Development Roadmap](./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
**Strategic planning document with prioritized development phases**
- **Phase 1:** Critical security fixes and data integrity (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Core features and performance improvements (4-6 weeks)
- **Phase 3:** User experience and code quality (3-4 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Advanced features and scaling (4-6 weeks)

### 📋 [Current Features](./CURRENT_FEATURES.md)
**Complete inventory of implemented functionality**
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture with RLS
- ✅ User authentication and session management
- ✅ Client, ticket, and time entry management
- ✅ Basic dashboard with real-time metrics
- ✅ Partial invoice system (backend only)
- 🚫 Missing: Reports, notifications, user roles, client portal

### 🔴 [Critical Fixes TODO](./TODO_CRITICAL_FIXES.md)
**Immediate action items for security and stability**
- **URGENT:** Database security overhaul (excessive anonymous permissions)
- **URGENT:** API route tenant isolation (data breach risk)
- **HIGH:** Database integrity constraints (data corruption prevention)
- **HIGH:** Fix broken ESLint configuration
- **MEDIUM:** Performance optimizations and error handling

### 🚀 [Feature Development TODO](./TODO_FEATURES.md)
**Comprehensive feature backlog and implementation guides**
- **Core Missing:** Complete invoice management UI
- **Core Missing:** Advanced reports and analytics
- **Core Missing:** Ticket comments system
- **Enhancement:** User roles and team management
- **Enhancement:** Client portal and notifications

## 🔍 Quick Assessment Summary

### Security Status: 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**
- Anonymous users have excessive database permissions
- API routes lack tenant isolation checks
- Registration process has race conditions
- Missing input validation and rate limiting

### Feature Completeness: 🟡 **60% COMPLETE**
- Core CRUD operations: ✅ Implemented
- Dashboard and metrics: ✅ Implemented
- Reports system: 🔴 Placeholder only
- Invoice management: 🟡 Backend only
- User management: 🔴 Not implemented
- Notifications: 🔴 Not implemented

### Code Quality: 🟡 **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**
- ESLint configuration broken
- Inconsistent error handling
- Missing test infrastructure
- Console logging instead of proper logging

### Performance: 🟢 **ACCEPTABLE FOR MVP**
- Database indexes adequate for small scale
- Frontend performance acceptable
- Needs optimization for larger datasets

## 🎯 Recommended Immediate Actions

### Week 1 Priority (Security)
1. **Fix database permissions** - Remove excessive grants to anonymous role
2. **Add tenant checks** - Secure all API routes with proper isolation
3. **Database constraints** - Add missing NOT NULL and validation constraints

### Week 2 Priority (Stability)
1. **Fix ESLint** - Restore code quality checking
2. **Atomic registration** - Use database transactions for user signup
3. **Error handling** - Replace console logging with proper error management

### Week 3-4 Priority (Features)
1. **Complete reports** - Replace placeholder with real implementation
2. **Invoice UI** - Build frontend for existing invoice backend
3. **Testing setup** - Add unit and integration test framework
