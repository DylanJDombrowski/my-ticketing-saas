## Implementation Guidelines

### Sprint Planning
- Each sprint = 2 weeks
- Focus on completing full features rather than partial implementations
- Include testing and documentation in all estimates
- Review and adjust priorities based on user feedback

### Quality Gates
- All code must pass ESLint and TypeScript checks
- Security review required for all authentication/authorization changes
- Performance testing required for database schema changes
- User acceptance testing for all UI changes

### Risk Mitigation
- Database changes require backup and rollback plans
- Security fixes should be deployed immediately to staging for testing
- Feature flags should be used for major new functionality
- Regular security audits during each phase
