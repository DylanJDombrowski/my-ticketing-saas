- Limited to 100 emails/day

### 4. Environment Variables

RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# From Email Address (required)
# Use your verified domain or resend test domain
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=invoices@yourdomain.com
# OR for testing:

# App URL for PDF links (required for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
# OR for local testing:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Add to Vercel

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://your-app.vercel.app`
3. Click **Save**
