## üß™ Testing Checklist

### 1. Test Email Notifications

**Goal:** Verify Resend is sending invoice emails properly

**Steps:**
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in to dashboard
3. Create a client with YOUR email address
4. Create a ticket for that client
5. Log some time entries for the ticket
6. Create an invoice from time entries
7. Click the **3-dot menu** on the invoice
8. Click **Send Invoice**
9. Check your email inbox for invoice email

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Email arrives with subject: "Invoice [number] from [your tenant name]"
- ‚úÖ Email has purple gradient header
- ‚úÖ Shows correct invoice number, amount, dates
- ‚úÖ "View Invoice PDF" button works
- ‚úÖ Invoice status changes to "sent" in dashboard

**Troubleshooting:**
- If no email arrives, check Resend dashboard logs: https://resend.com/emails
- Verify `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is verified domain or `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Check browser console for errors

### 2. Test Stripe Webhook (Local Development)

**Goal:** Ensure webhooks receive and process payment events

**Prerequisites:**
- Install Stripe CLI: `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`

**Steps:**

**Terminal 1 - Dev Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Stripe Webhook Listener:**
```bash
# Login to Stripe (one-time setup)
stripe login

# Start webhook forwarding
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook
```

**Expected Output:**
```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxx (stored in .env.local)
> Listening on http://localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook
```

**Keep this terminal open!** You'll see webhook events here when payments are made.

- Restart dev server after changing env vars

### "Payment succeeded but invoice not marked paid"
**Cause:** Webhook not processing correctly
**Solution:**
- Check Terminal 2 for webhook errors
- Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set
- Check database permissions on payments/invoices tables

### "Email not arriving"
**Cause:** Resend configuration issue
**Solution:**
- Check Resend dashboard logs
- Verify `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` domain is verified
- For testing, use `onboarding@resend.dev`

### "Payment button not showing"
**Cause:** Invoice status or Stripe connection
**Solution:**
- Invoice must be "sent", "overdue", or "partial" status
- Stripe account must be connected and verified

## üìä Database Check

After successful payment, verify database records:

**Check Payment Record:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM payments
WHERE invoice_id = 'your-invoice-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Should show:**
- `status: 'succeeded'`
- `stripe_payment_intent_id: 'pi_xxx'`
- `paid_at: timestamp`

**Check Invoice:**
```sql
SELECT id, invoice_number, status, total_amount
FROM invoices
WHERE id = 'your-invoice-id';
```

**Should show:**
- `status: 'paid'`
