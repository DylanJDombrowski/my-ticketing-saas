## Part 1: Invoice Limit Enforcement ‚úÖ

### Test 1.1: Verify Invoice Count is Synced

**Run this SQL query:**
```sql
SELECT
  name,
  invoice_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE tenant_id = tenants.id) as actual,
  invoice_limit
FROM tenants;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
name                          | invoice_count | actual | invoice_limit
------------------------------|---------------|--------|---------------
Dombrowski Technologies LLC   | 4             | 4      | 2
```

‚úÖ **PASS**: invoice_count matches actual count
‚ùå **FAIL**: If they don't match, re-run the UPDATE query from FIX_BOTH_ISSUES_NOW.sql

---

### Test 1.2: Try to Create 5th Invoice (Should Block)

**Steps:**
1. Log into dashboard: https://trybillable.com/dashboard
2. Go to Invoices
3. Click "Create Invoice" or "Quick Invoice"
4. Fill in details and submit

**Expected Result:**
- ‚ùå **Upgrade prompt should appear** (modal with "You've reached your free plan limit")
- ‚ùå **Invoice should NOT be created**
- ‚úÖ **Modal shows**: "2 / 2 invoices" used

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after testing]_

---

### Test 1.3: Upgrade Flow

**Steps:**
1. In upgrade prompt, click **"Upgrade Now"**
2. Should redirect to Stripe Checkout
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete payment
5. Should redirect back to dashboard

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Redirects to Stripe (URL starts with checkout.stripe.com)
- ‚úÖ Shows "Billable Pro - $6.99/month"
- ‚úÖ After payment, returns to: `/dashboard/settings?session_id=...&success=true`

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after testing]_

---

### Test 1.4: Verify Subscription Activated

**Run this SQL query after payment:**
```sql
SELECT
  name,
  subscription_status,
  invoice_limit,
  stripe_customer_id,
  stripe_subscription_id
FROM tenants;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
name                          | subscription_status | invoice_limit | stripe_customer_id | stripe_subscription_id
------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------
Dombrowski Technologies LLC   | active             | 999999        | cus_...           | sub_...
```

‚úÖ **PASS**: subscription_status = 'active' and invoice_limit = 999999
‚ùå **FAIL**: If status is still 'free', webhook didn't fire

---

### Test 1.5: Create Unlimited Invoices (After Upgrade)

**Steps:**
1. After upgrading, try to create 5th, 6th, 7th invoice
2. Should work without any blocking

**Expected Result:**

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after testing]_

---

## Part 2: Client Portal Access ‚úÖ

### Test 2.1: Verify Portal Tokens Exist

**Run this SQL query:**
```sql
SELECT
  c.name as client_name,
  c.email,
  cpa.access_token,
  cpa.is_active,
  'https://trybillable.com/client-portal/' || cpa.access_token as portal_url
FROM client_portal_access cpa
JOIN clients c ON c.id = cpa.client_id
WHERE cpa.is_active = true;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Should show at least 1 row
- `access_token` should be a long random string (not NULL)
- `is_active` should be true

‚úÖ **PASS**: Tokens exist
‚ùå **FAIL**: If no rows or access_token is NULL, RLS policy didn't work

---

- Check RLS policies were created

---

### Test 2.4: Test Old Portal Links (Retroactive Fix)

**Steps:**
1. Find an old invoice email you sent before
2. Click the portal link
3. Should work now (if retroactive token was created)

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Portal loads (if token was created retroactively)
- ‚ùå Access Denied (if client didn't have invoices when fix ran)

**Note**: This only works if the client had at least one invoice when you ran FIX_BOTH_ISSUES_NOW.sql

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after testing]_

---

  - ‚úÖ invoice.payment_failed

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after checking]_

---

### Test 3.2: Test Webhook Event Delivery

**After completing payment in Test 1.3:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events
2. Look for recent events
3. Click on `checkout.session.completed` event
4. Check "Webhook attempts" section

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Shows webhook attempt to your endpoint
- ‚úÖ Response: 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Response body: `{"received":true}`

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after testing]_

## Part 4: Edge Cases & Error Handling ‚úÖ

### Test 4.1: Multiple Clients Same Tenant

**If you have multiple clients:**
1. Send invoices to 2 different clients
2. Each should get their own portal token
3. Each portal should only show THEIR invoices

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Client A sees only their invoices
- ‚úÖ Client B sees only their invoices
- ‚ùå Client A cannot see Client B's data

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in if applicable]_

---

### Test 4.2: Expired Tokens

**To test token expiration:**
1. In database, set a token to expired:
```sql
UPDATE client_portal_access
SET expires_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE client_id = (SELECT id FROM clients LIMIT 1);
```

2. Try to access portal with that token

**Expected Result:**
- ‚ùå Shows "Access Denied - Token expired"
- ‚úÖ Sending new invoice email creates fresh token

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after testing]_

---

### Test 4.3: Invoice Count Accuracy

**After creating several invoices:**
```sql
SELECT
  name,
  invoice_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE tenant_id = tenants.id) as actual
FROM tenants;
```

**Expected Result:**
- invoice_count should ALWAYS match actual count
- Trigger should increment automatically on new invoices

**Actual Result:** _[Fill this in after creating invoices]_

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Upgrade prompt doesn't show
**Fix**: Run FIX_BOTH_ISSUES_NOW.sql again, check invoice_count is synced

### Issue: Portal shows "Access Denied"
**Fix**: Check RLS policy exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'client_portal_access';
```

### Issue: Webhook not working
**Fix**:
1. Check STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env
2. Verify endpoint is publicly accessible
3. Check Stripe Dashboard for error details

### Issue: Invoice count not incrementing
**Fix**: Trigger might not be working. Check:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_invoice_created';
```

**Run this to see overall system health:**
```sql
-- Comprehensive status check

    ELSE '‚ùå Broken'
  END as status
FROM tenants t
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Portal Tokens' as feature,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client_portal_access WHERE is_active = true) > 0

UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Subscription' as feature,
