## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Database Migration

1. **Review constraint rename script:**
   ```bash
   cat RENAME_CONSTRAINTS.sql
   ```

2. **Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Copy contents of `RENAME_CONSTRAINTS.sql`
   - Paste in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

3. **Verify results:**
   ```sql
   -- Run verification query from script
   SELECT con.conname, con.conrelid::regclass, ...
   ```

4. **Expected results:**
   - 8 constraints renamed
   - All "ticket" references changed to "task"
   - No errors

### For Documentation Maintenance

- ✅ Primary docs stay in root (README, CLAUDE, PROGRESS, VISION)
- ✅ Setup guides go to `/docs/setup/`
- ✅ Migration scripts go to `/docs/migrations/`
- ✅ Historical/completed work goes to `/docs/archive/`
- ✅ Always update `/docs/INDEX.md` when adding new docs

## 📈 Impact

### Developer Experience

- ✅ Historical docs archived but accessible

### Maintenance
- ✅ New docs have a clear home
- ✅ Outdated docs moved to archive (not deleted)
- ✅ Single source of truth for each topic
- ✅ Migration guides with SQL scripts ready to run
