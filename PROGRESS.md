## Session Rules & Conventions

### Progress Tracking
1. **Always update this document** at the start and end of coding sessions
2. **Use TodoWrite tool** for task tracking during active work
3. **Document key decisions** and architectural changes
4. **Track time estimates** vs actual completion time

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Run `npm run lint`** after making changes
2. **Write tests** for new components and business logic
3. **Update documentation** when adding new features
4. **Follow existing patterns** established in the codebase

### Sprint Management
1. **Keep sprints focused** - 5-7 tasks maximum
2. **Prefer incremental progress** over large rewrites
3. **Complete current sprint** before starting new work
4. **Document blockers** and dependencies immediately
