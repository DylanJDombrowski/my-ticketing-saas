### Architecture Considerations

#### New Database Tables/Columns
```sql
-- Invoice approval workflow
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN approval_status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft';
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN approved_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id);
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN approved_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Time entry approval
ALTER TABLE time_entries ADD COLUMN approval_status TEXT DEFAULT 'submitted';
ALTER TABLE time_entries ADD COLUMN approved_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id);
ALTER TABLE time_entries ADD COLUMN approved_at TIMESTAMP;

-- SLA configuration
CREATE TABLE sla_rules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  ticket_priority TEXT NOT NULL,
  response_time_hours INTEGER,
  resolution_time_hours INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- Client portal access
CREATE TABLE client_portal_access (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id),
  access_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_accessed TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- Email notifications log
CREATE TABLE notification_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
  recipient_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  notification_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### New API Routes
- `POST /api/invoices/auto-generate` - Auto-generate invoice from time entries
- `POST /api/notifications/send` - Send email notifications
- `GET /api/client-portal/[token]` - Client portal access
- `POST /api/time-entries/approve` - Approve time entries
- `GET /api/sla/status` - SLA monitoring dashboard
- `POST /api/payments/stripe-webhook` - Handle payment confirmations

#### New Components
- `src/components/invoice-auto-generator.tsx` - Bulk invoice creation
- `src/components/client-portal-layout.tsx` - Separate layout for clients
- `src/components/time-entry-approval.tsx` - Approval workflow UI
- `src/components/sla-monitor.tsx` - SLA dashboard
- `src/components/notification-center.tsx` - Notification management
- `src/app/client-portal/` - Client-facing pages
- `src/app/api/notifications/` - Email notification API

### Implementation Priority
1. **Week 1**: Email notifications + Auto invoice generation
2. **Week 2**: Time entry approval workflows + Client portal
3. **Week 3**: SLA monitoring + Payment integration

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Email delivery issues
  **Mitigation**: Start with Supabase Edge Functions + Resend.com for reliability

- **Risk**: Payment integration complexity
  **Mitigation**: Start with basic Stripe integration, expand later

- **Risk**: Client portal security
  **Mitigation**: Use secure token-based access, limit data exposure
