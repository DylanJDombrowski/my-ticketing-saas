-- Seed data for local development and testing
-- This creates sample data to test the application

-- Note: This seed data is only for local development
-- Production data should be migrated separately

-- Sample tenant (will be created automatically when users sign up)
-- Sample clients, tickets, etc. can be added here for testing

-- For now, this file is intentionally minimal
-- Users will create their own data through the application

-- You can add test data here if needed for development:
-- INSERT INTO tenants (id, name) VALUES
--   ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'Test Company');

-- INSERT INTO clients (tenant_id, name, email) VALUES
--   ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'Test Client', 'test@example.com');
